## Client and Loan Management System

**Objective**
The main objective of this project is to create an API to manage clients and the loan payments control system from a fin-tech.

**Purpose**
The purpose of this challenge is to test your ability to implement a solution given an abstract problem. You may find a problem in the asked task that you need to explain the problem and propose a solution to fix it.

**Problem**
A fin-tech needs to create and manage the clients and keep track of the amount of money loaned and the missed/made payments. It also needs a place to retrieve the volume of outstanding debt at some point in time.

**Business Rules**
- If a client contracted a loan in the past and paid all without missing any payment, you can decrease by 0.02% his tax rate;
- If a client contracted a loan in the past and paid all but missed until 3 monthly payments, you can increase by 0.04% his tax rate;
- If a client contracted a loan in the past and paid all but missed more than 3 monthly payments or didn’t pay all the loan, you need to deny the new one.

**Limitations**
Loans are paid back in monthly instalments;
Can’t pay above loan amount;
Will not be able to receive a value above the total.

### POST /loans

**Summary**
Create a loan application. Loans are automatically accepted.

**Restrictions**
- In creating the Loan you should consider the last loan to decide the rate used;
- In creating the Loan can only be released if it is current with the current  or does not have any;
- In the consultation of the Loan the date is not before the date of the beginning of the loan;
- In the Loan query, a data can’t be used later.

**Payload**

    client_id: the client’s identification that contracted a loan.
    amount: loan amount in dollars.
    term: number of months that will take until the loan gets paid-off.
    rate: interest rate as decimal.
    date: when the loan was requested (origination date as an ISO 8601 string).

**Example of sent data**

    {
        “client_id”: 1,
        “amount”: 1000,
        “term”: 12,
        “rate”: 0.05,

        “instalment”: 85.60
    }

**Notes**

**Loan payment formula**

    r = rate / term
    instalment = [r + r / ((1 + r) ^ term - 1)] x amount

**Example**

**For repaying a loan of $1000 at 5% interest for 12 months, the equation would be:**

    instalment = [(0.05 / 12) + (0.05 / 12) / ((1 + (0.05 / 12)) ^ 12 - 1] x 1000
    instalment = 85.60
